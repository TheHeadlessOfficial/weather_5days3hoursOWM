## **WIKI**<br>

Download the .zip file, extract the files, copy the file `.conkyrc_owm5d3h` and the folder `.conky` inside your Linux `home`.<br>
If your `home` is named *pippo*, copy inside *pippo* so you get: `/home/pippo/.conky` and `/home/pippo/.conkyrc_owm5d3h`<br>
Go to `/home/YOURHOMENAME/.conky/weather/Openweathermap/5DAYS3HOURS/` and open with a text editor the file `5days3hours.py`, go to row 16 and 17 and type your latitude and your longitude, go to row 18 and write your APPID.<br>
If you don't know how to get your APPID, follow this video instructions: [APPID guide](https://youtu.be/FxcR7c3YwEQ?si=wD5IBWCfEG1cvo1p&t=65)
<br>
In the `font` folder, you can find some fonts you need.<br>
The python script saves data in files so you can build your conky weather as you wish.<br>
The `.conkyrc_owm5d3h` file i attach, works.<br>
Run the file `.conkyrc_owm5d3h` from terminal (the first time you run this conky), so you can get possible errors.<br>
You have to create your conky statements in `.conkyrc_owm5d3h` file, inside the block where you read `WRITE YOUR CONKY STATEMENTS IN THIS BLOCK`
